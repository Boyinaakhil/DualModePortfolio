⚡ Prompt: Akhil B — Dual-Mode Interactive MERN + DSA Portfolio

Prompt:

Create an advanced, futuristic developer portfolio website for Akhil B (Boyina Akhil) featuring two dynamic panels:

🧠 Panel 1: Terminal View (Default Mode)

Styled like a modern Linux shell, header prompt: akhilb@portfolio:$

Green-on-black hacker aesthetic with slight CRT glow.

Commands supported:

help → lists commands (ls, cat, cd, open, resume, leetcode, gfg, clear, theme)

ls → displays files: about.txt, skills/, projects/, achievements/, resume.pdf

cat about.txt → prints Akhil’s introduction

cd projects → lists real projects with short one-line summaries

open resume.pdf → opens the resume in a modal or viewer

leetcode → fetches LeetCode profile (placeholder API)

gfg → opens GeeksforGeeks profile

theme → toggles theme (neon green, matrix blue, amber CRT)

whoami → returns “Akhil B — MERN Stack Developer | DSA Enthusiast”

sudo rm -rf / → playful Easter egg ASCII art saying “Access Denied! Nice try 😉”

Add:

Typing animation with blinking cursor

Autocomplete on Tab, command history with ↑ ↓ keys

Sound effects for typing and command execution

Animated fake “system uptime” and “memory usage” display

Button → “Switch to Simple View”

💼 Panel 2: Simple View (Professional GUI Mode)

A glassmorphic, animated interface with a clean, modern dark theme.

Smooth Framer Motion transitions and parallax hover effects.
